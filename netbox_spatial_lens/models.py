"""
Floor geometry.

NetBox knows a rack's height, footprint, power feeds and cooling capability. It does not know
where the rack stands in the room. These two models hold that, and nothing else: a `Floor` is
a room, and a `RackPlacement` is one rack standing in it.

Footprints are deliberately absent. A placement stores a position and an angle; how big the
rack is, is read from the rack itself at render time. That way a re-measured rack changes size
on the floor without anybody redrawing it, and the picture cannot disagree with the inventory.
