"""
The cables that leave a rack, and the ones that leave the room.

A rack elevation shows what is plugged into a rack; it cannot show where the other end went.
That is a floor-level question ("which cabinets does this row actually depend on", "what runs
under this aisle"), and it is the one thing a floor plan can answer that no other NetBox page
can.

One line per pair of racks, not one per cable. A pair of racks joined by forty fibres would
otherwise be forty identical overlapping lines: slow to draw, impossible to read, and no more
informative than a single line labelled forty. The count becomes the line's weight instead.

Cables with both ends in the same rack are left out; they are internal to a cabinet and the
elevation already draws them.

A cable whose far end is nowhere on this floor is not dropped, though. A branch office is one
rack and a circuit to a provider, and a plan that draws only rack-to-rack runs shows that room
as having no cabling at all, which is the opposite of the truth. Those are drawn as exits: a
stub from the rack to the nearest wall, named after whatever it reaches.
