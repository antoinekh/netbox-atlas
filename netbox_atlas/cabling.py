"""
Resolving what is on the other end of a cable, in bulk.

NetBox exposes this per object, as `termination.link_peers`, which walks the cable and its
terminations one at a time. That is the right shape for a page about one interface and the
wrong one for a page about a rack: a rack of twelve devices cost 177 queries, almost all of
them the same two walks repeated.

Everything here works on sets. A cable termination is a generic foreign key, so it cannot be
prefetched in one query, but it can be grouped by content type and fetched one query per model
instead of one per row. `CableTermination` also denormalises `_device` and `_rack`, so the
common questions ("which device is that end on", "is it in this rack") are answered without
touching the device table at all.

The rack view's cable runs are built here too, for the same reason: a run is a cable seen
from one rack, and everything it needs is already resolved above.
