"""
The inside of a rack, as data.

Where each device sits, what reserved and free space there is, and every cable leaving a device
in the rack, in rack units. `scene` turns this into the 3D drawing; the stat strip, the port
allocation and the cabling list read it directly. Keeping the rack's facts apart from the
drawing is what lets the arithmetic that decides where a device sits test without a browser.

What a device holds is not this module's business. Ports live in `ports`, power in `power`, and
cables in `cabling`; this assembles their answers per device.
