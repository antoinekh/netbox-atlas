"""
Every colour this plugin assigns meaning to.

One source, because the same idea was being spelled out in four places: a cable kind's colour
lived in `cabling.py`, again in the allocation bars, again in the trace panel's hop borders,
and again in the map's polylines. Changing one of them changed the drawing and left the legend
saying something else.

Only *semantic* colour belongs here: the colours that stand for something, where the drawing
and the legend must agree. Chrome that follows the NetBox theme, such as borders and muted
text, uses NetBox's own Bootstrap variables with a fallback and is none of this module's
business.

The palette reaches CSS as custom properties, emitted by `inc/palette.html`, so a rule that
needs one writes `var(--atlas-kind-power)` rather than repeating the value.
