"""
A floor, as a 3D scene.

The same room the plan draws, in millimetres and standing up: every rack a cabinet at its real
footprint, position, rotation and height, coloured by the floor's colouring, and the cabling
between racks and off the floor as tubes over their tops. The browser only draws what this
decides, so the geometry tests without a browser, the way the rack's does.

Built from what the floor page has already worked out (`build_layout`, `build_floor_runs`,
`build_floor_exits`), which applied the reader's permissions and the colouring. A second walk
of the same rows would be a second answer that could disagree with the plan beside it.

The axes follow the renderer and the plan together: the plan's x is x, the plan's y (down the
page) is z, and y is up. The origin is the room's corner the plan puts at its top left.
