/*
 * What the reader has narrowed a drawing to, kept in the URL hash.
 *
 * The colouring is in the query string, because the server draws it. Picked bands, ticked rows
 * and the find box are the browser's own business, and they used to be lost on every reload and
 * could not be sent to anybody. The hash keeps them without a request, and a copied link opens
 * the drawing narrowed the same way.
 *
 * One key can hold several values (`band-racks=a&band-racks=b`), so a value never has to be
 * escaped against a separator of our own. Loaded before the scripts that use it.
